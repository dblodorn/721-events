# Zora Modal Provider

Pretty thin wrapper over the Modal already in Zord = perhaps we should just include thr provider and hook in zord?

```
<ModalComposition
  modalName={nft?.metadata?.name}
  trigger={
    <div>YOUR BUTTON STUFF</div>
  }
  content={
    <div>WHATS IN THE MODAL</div>
  }
/>

```
